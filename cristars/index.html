            <p>
                Cristars Badminton Club was formed in 2000 by multiple National Senior Champion, Anil Seepaul.
                In creating the Cristars Badminton Club, Anil filled a void in the training of National Junior Badminton
                athletes in the Central/Chaguanas area. We have had multiple players both on the National Junior and
                Senior Teams with club members being part of the National Team that participated in Carebaco Championships,
                Central American and Caribbean (CAC) Games, Pan American Games and Commonwealth Games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cristars Badminton Club is based at the Chaguanas Regional Indoor Sporting Arena. The club is a
                competitive club with limited space for recreational players. We are affiliated with the Trinidad and
                Tobago Badminton Association.
