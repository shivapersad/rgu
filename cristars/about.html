        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <section>
            <p>
                Cristars Badminton Club was started in 2000 by Anil Seepaul. The first group of players was small in
                number but were staples on the National Badminton Junior Team thanks to the training of Anil Seepaul.
                As the club grew in popularity especially among the Presentation College Chaguanas population its numbers
                also increased. The club still has quite a few members both present and past students of Presentation
                College Chaguanas but have also had students from St. Augustine Girls High School, St. Joseph Convent
                Penal and Couva Secondary School.
            </p>

            <p>
                Both Junior and Senior players of the club have been to Carebaco Championships, Central American and
                Caribbean Games, Pan American Games and Commonwealth Games. Our training regime is rigorous.
